## Financial Planning Fundamentals

### Understanding Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)

A Systematic Investment Plan allows investors to invest small amounts regularly rather than making lump-sum investments. The benefits include:

1. **Rupee-Cost Averaging**: Automatically buying more units when prices are low
2. **Disciplined Investing**: Creating a habit of regular investing
3. **Power of Compounding**: Earning returns on your returns over time
4. **Lower Initial Investment**: Starting with smaller amounts

Our SIPCalculator helps visualize these benefits with customizable parameters and realistic growth projections.

### Home Loan EMI Considerations

When taking a home loan, understanding the complete financial picture is crucial:

1. **Principal vs. Interest Ratio**: How much of your payment goes to interest
2. **Loan Tenure Impact**: The trade-off between EMI amount and total interest paid
3. **Prepayment Benefits**: How making additional payments affects your loan
4. **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: How rate changes impact your finances

Our HomeLoanEMICalculator provides clear visualization of these factors to support better decision-making.
